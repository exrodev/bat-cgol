# Conway's Game of Life in Batch
A poorly optimized version of Conway's Game of Life created in Batch.

Board wrapping has not been implemented, if you would like to implement that, feel free but I don't plan to.

I posted this in the 'server.bat' Discord server where you can share and talk about Batch scripting. If you would like to join, click [here](https://discord.gg/zEf7aKZEgG).
